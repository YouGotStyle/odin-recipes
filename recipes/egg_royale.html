    <p><h4>Making your own muffins is such an easy, rewarding thing to
         do and the taste is next-level delicious. This recipe makes
          more than you need, but who doesn’t love a cheeky toasted muffin with a cuppa? Here, I’ve 
          buddied them up with spinach, smoked salmon and eggs, but they’re also great with ham, halloumi or a
          vocado. Anything goes!</h4></p>

    <br>

        <li><em>½ a lemon</em></li>
        <li><em>butter, for greasing</em></li>
        <li><em>4 large free-range eggs</em></li>
        <li><em>200 g smoked salmon, from sustainable sources</em></li>
        <li><em>fresh chervil, to serve (optional)</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p><h3>Muffins:</h3></p>

    <ul>
        <li><em>450 ml tepid milk</em></li>
        <li><em>1 x 7 g sachet yeast</em></li>
        <li><em>2 teaspoons caster sugar</em></li>
        <li><em>700 g strong white bread flour , plus extra for dusting</em></li>
        <li><em>50 g semolina</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p><h3>Hollandaise:</h3></p>

    <ul>
        <li><em>200 g unsalted butter</em></li>
        <li><em>4 large free-range egg yolks</em></li>
        <li><em>½ a lemon</em></li>
        <li><em>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</em></li>
        <li><em>white wine vinegar</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p><h3>Method:</h3></p>

    <ol>
        <li><em>To make the muffins, place the milk in a jug, stir in the yeast and sugar, and leave for a couple of minutes until frothy.</em></li>
        <br>
        <li><em>Place the flour and 2 teaspoons of fine sea salt into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the middle. Pour in the milk mixture and mix well to form a dough. Shape into a ball and knead with clean hands or in a freestanding mixer until smooth and elastic. Place in an oiled bowl, cover with a clean damp tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</em></li>
        <br>
        <li><em>Knock back the dough and roll out on a flour-dusted surface to about 2cm thick. Stamp out 10 level circles with an 8cm round cutter, rerolling as necessary.</em></li>
        <br>
        <li><em>Carefully place the muffins onto a large tray lined with a large sheet of semolina-dusted greaseproof paper and sprinkle over a little more semolina. Cover with a tea towel and leave to prove for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</em></li>
        <br>
        <li><em>Heat a heavy non-stick pan or griddle over a low heat, add the muffins and cook for 6 to 7 minutes on each side or until golden – you may need to do this in batches. Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly.</em></li>
        <br>
        <li><em>Meanwhile, make the hollandaise. Gently melt the butter in a small pan.</em></li>
        <br>
        <li><em>Whisk the egg yolks, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and the mustard in a heatproof bowl set over a shallow pan of simmering water.</em></li>
        <br>
        <li><em>Slowly pour in the melted butter, whisking constantly until well combined. Whisk in a splash of vinegar, then have a taste and season to perfection. Turn the heat off and keep warm over the pan of water, stirring occasionally. Loosen with a splash of water if needed.</em></li>
        <br>
        <li><em>Trim, wash and finely chop the spring onions. Peel and finely slice the garlic.</em></li>
        <br>
        <li><em>Place a large frying pan on a medium-low heat with a little drizzle of olive oil, add the spring onions, garlic and spinach, then pick in the marjoram. Finely grate over some nutmeg, then add a pinch of sea salt and some freshly ground black pepper. Cook for 5 minutes or until the spinach is dark and delicious. Add lemon juice to taste and keep warm until ready to serve.</em></li>
        <br>
        <li><em>Place a large, shallow pan of water on a medium heat and bring to the boil.</em></li>
        <br>
        <li><em>Grease four tea cups with butter and crack an egg into each. Place the cups in the pan of water, then cover and poach for 4 to 5 minutes or until the eggs are cooked to your liking.</em></li>
        <br>
        <li><em>To assemble, halve 4 warm muffins and divide the spinach and smoked salmon between each. Top with a perfectly poached egg, lightly season, then spoon a tablespoon of hollandaise over each one. Finish with a final grating of nutmeg and a few sprigs of chervil, if you like.</em></li>
    </ol>

    <p><h4>Tips:</h4></p>
    <p><em>To keep your hollandaise in a stable, warm condition, put it into a preheated Thermos flask while you get on with the rest of the cooking. Simply pour it over your eggs when you’re ready to plate up. Job done!</em></p>
